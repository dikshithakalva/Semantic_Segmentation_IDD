# Semantic_Segmentation_IDD

Semantic segmentation is a computer vision technique that assigns a specific class label to each pixel in an image. This allows for a detailed understanding of the image content, going beyond simply identifying objects to pinpointing their exact locations.
Imagine you can break down an image into tiny pieces, and for each piece, you tell a computer what it is. Semantic segmentation does exactly that with deep learning! It analyzes every single pixel in an image and assigns a label, like "pedestrian" or "traffic sign," allowing applications like medical imaging or autonomous vehicles to make sense of their surroundings.
